Smart contracts are business logics written in machine readable format aka as programming languages. This code is executed by the nodes in network in a sandboxed deterministic environment.
Rubix considers smart contracts as a type of Non Fungible Token with a state. Each time a contract function is invoked , the state of contract is updated and maintained in chain called Contract Token Chain.  This chain provides an immutable proof of execution of contract.
Rubix smart contracts are written in web2 languages such as Rust , javaScript , GoLang and executed in WASM environment. Rubix is build for higher and easier adoption and using dev familiar web2 languages certainly goes a long way to enable that.
